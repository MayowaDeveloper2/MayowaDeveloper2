## 👋 About Me

I am a passionate and results-driven software developer with expertise in building web, mobile, and desktop applications. My core focus lies in architecting and developing scalable, high-performance systems that solve real-world problems — particularly within distributed systems and modern software architectures.

Driven by curiosity and continuous learning, I explore and prototype innovative solutions through hands-on research. The architectures and projects featured in my repositories are the direct outcome of my independent investigations and technical experimentation.

I specialize in crafting modern, user-focused front-end applications using technologies such as React.js, Next.js, Vue.js, Vite, and TanStack Query, Python, FastAPI, among others. I leverage cutting-edge frontend ecosystems and patterns to deliver performant, maintainable, and enterprise-grade solutions capable of adapting to complex, real-time business environments.
